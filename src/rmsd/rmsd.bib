@article{2004Coutsias,
abstract = {A widely used way to compare the structures of biomolecules or solid bodies is to translate and rotate one structure with respect to the other to minimize the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). We present a simple derivation, based on quaternions, for the optimal solid body transformation (rotation-translation) that minimizes the RMSD between two sets of vectors. We prove that the quaternion method is equivalent to the well-known formula due to Kabsch. We analyze the various cases that may arise, and give a complete enumeration of the special cases in terms of the arrangement of the eigenvalues of a traceless, 4×4 symmetric matrix. A key result here is an expression for the gradient of the RMSD as a function of model parameters. This can be useful, for example, in finding the minimum energy path of a reaction using the elastic band methods or in optimizing model parameters to best fit a target structure. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Quaternions are an important tool to describe the orientation of a molecule. This paper considers the use of quaternions in matching two conformations of a molecule, in interpolating rotations, in performing statistics on orientational data, in the random sampling of rotations, and in establishing grids in orientation space. These examples show that many of the rotational problems that arise in molecular modeling may be handled simply and efficiently using quaternions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

@article{2019Coutsias,
abstract = {A common approach for comparing the structures of biomolecules or solid bodies is to translate and rotate one structure with respect to the other to minimize the pointwise root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). We present a new, robust numerical algorithm that computes the RMSD between two molecules or all the mutual RMSDs of a list of molecules and, if desired, the corresponding rotation matrix in a minimal number of operations as compared to previous algorithms. The RMSD gradient can also be computed. We address the problem of symmetry, both in alignment (possible alternative alignments due to indistinguishable atoms) as well as geometry. In the latter case, it is possible to have degenerate superposition. A necessary condition is optimal superimposability to one's mirror image. Double (respectively, triple) degeneracy results in a one- (respectively, two)-parameter family of rotations leaving the superposition invariant.

abstract = {Quaternions describe rotations in the 3-dimensional space by using four components, which consist of a rotation axis vector and an angle.The quantities can avoid such singularities as Euler angles have.For that reason, the quaternion methods have been traditionally used for attitude determinations of flying objects in aerospace and defense areas.Recently the quaternions are used in 3-dimensional computer graphics to represent objects.There are generally two different definitions of the quaternions, which sometimes lead to confusion.We summarize useful formulas for the attitude calculations of the fling objects in this report},
